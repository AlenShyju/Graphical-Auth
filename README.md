"# Graphical-Auth" 


Traditional text-based passwords suffer from significant security and usability challenges, including poor memorability, susceptibility to phishing, and brute-force attacks. Graphical authentication systems (GAS) leverage human cognitive strengths by replacing alphanumeric passwords with visual elements, offering an alternative approach. However, existing GAS models, such as Passfaces, Draw-a-Secret, and Cued Click Points, still face critical issues like shoulder-surfing vulnerability, low entropy, and usability-security trade-offs.

To address these limitations, we introduce MLGAB—a Multi-Layered Graphical Authentication Framework designed to enhance security while maintaining user convenience. MLGAB integrates three key components:

Image-Based Authentication – Users select visual tokens as authentication elements.
Dynamic Sequence Input – Incorporates temporal and spatial patterns to resist attacks.
Behavioural Biometrics – Utilizes machine learning to analyse touch pressure, gesture dynamics, and timing patterns for anomaly detection.
